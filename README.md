# makefile

Notes and experiments around Makefile.

_In software development, Make is a build automation tool that automatically builds executable programs and libraries from source code by reading files called Makefiles which specify how to derive the target program. Though integrated development environments and language-specific compiler features can also be used to manage a build process, Make remains widely used, especially in Unix and Unix-like operating systems._

A Makefile is a special file used in software development to automate the build process of a program. It specifies the dependencies between files and the commands to build the executable file from source code. The make tool reads the Makefile and builds the program based on the specified rules.
